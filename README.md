## Notes

| :warning: WARNING          |

| This repo is not actively maintained. |

I have set up dependabot to automatically trigger PRs to ensure that the dependencies have the latest security updates. That said, those updates may have broken the compatability with the other dependent libraries. This may require you to play around with the package versions in `requirements.txt`. I recommend starting with the most well maintained packages first (e.g., `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.). If you find this is the case, and manage to find a selection of packages that work, I encourage you to submit a pr with changes to `requirements.txt`.
